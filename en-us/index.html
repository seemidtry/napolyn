                        <strong>QUESTION: </strong>Why Windows Defender percieve Napolyn as trojan?<br><br>

                        <strong>ANSWER: </strong>Anti-virus softwares are designed to catch third-party files and
                        softwares like .dll files. Third-party files are usually used to integrate other platforms each
                        other but also <strong>malwares</strong> and game cheats are third-party too. Thats why Windows
                        Defender marks Napolyn as trojan.
